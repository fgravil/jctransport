		 	<div class="description">
			 	<p>The transportation marketplace is larger than ever and the companies that provide transportation are 
			 	still unable to satisfy all the customers in our city. It has become urgent for us to participate as a 
			 	collective group to provide a family-friendly transportation to all. It is a fundamental policy at J&amp;C Private 
			 	Transportation, INC. to not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, 
			 	handicap or disability.</p>

		 		 At J&amp;C, Our core values are based on four Keys: Safety, Integrity, Efficiency and Loyalty.
		 		 

		 		 <ul>
			 		<li> Safety- Safety is the first key that we use in our business. We make 
			 		 sure that our clients get to their destination safely and on time. 
			 		 It is important that we create and maintain safe environments and safe 
			 		 situations, all of the time.</li>
	 

					<li>Integrity- Our business values integrity. We make sure that our employees display qualities of 
					 honesty and a strong sense of ethics.</li>

					<li> Loyalty- We make sure that we show loyalty to all our clients. We believe that 
					 loyalty is a strong feeling of support or allegiance. We want to commit to our promises and give 
					 our clients the best service they deserve.</li>

					<li>Efficiency- Our next important key is efficiency. Through efficient practices as experienced drivers, 
					 we reduce wait times, make the ride to the destination quick, and give our clients the best value at a 
					 reasonable price.</li>
